Imports a folder of plaintext files into Apple Notes

Please see the "known issues" below before using.

I successfully used this on OS X 10.11 El Capitan. It probably does not work on earlier versions of OS X.

// Import a folder full of HTML or text files into Notes.app.
// Crude, but better than nothing. Maybe?
//
// Usage:
//   - Open this file in Script Editor
//   - Run

//
// Known issues:
//   - Attachments don't get imported
//   - Formatting/HTML is not preserved
//   - No idea how text encoding is handled
//   - File extension should be stripped from title of new note
//
